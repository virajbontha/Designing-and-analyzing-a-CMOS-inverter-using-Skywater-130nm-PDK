Shift+A to show netlist window

press e to enter a symbol and ctrl+e to exit out of a symbol.

Always connect the body pins.

Read theory of cmos_inverter.

Press netlist to get errors, if any.
Press simulate. write display to get list of possible graphs u can plot.

vm is the threshold value like above voltage above vm is logic 1 otherwise 0. To improve this, increase W (width) of pmos in the symbol.
To measure vm in the graph type in the following in the ngspice simulate window: meas dc vm vin=vout
